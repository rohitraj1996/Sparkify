# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree
## Sparkify Capstone Project

### Overview
<p>I did this project as a part of the course i.e. Data Scientist Nanodegree.</p>
<p>In this project I used user log of streaming service sparkify to predict user churn. This project uses Apache Spark python API pyspark.
</p>

<p>So we’ll deep dive into customer’s data and select appropriate machine learning models to predict churn. 
The following are the necessary steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load and clean data: Find nan values, change to correct data types.</li>
  <li>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Analyse data to find features.</li>
  <li>Feature Engineering: Extract the features, do One Hot Encoding on categorical features and scale numerical features.</li>
  <li>Model: Select a few machine learning algorithms, train them and check which is the best model. After selecting the 
      best model tune it’s hyperparameters.</li>
</ul>

### Libraries
<ul>
  <li>python 3.7 and above</li>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>matplotlib</li>
  <li>seaborn</li>
  <li>pyspark</li>
  <li>jupyter</li>
</ul>

### Blog post
<p>I wrote a blog on medium. Here is the <a href="https://medium.com/@z.rohitraj1997/predicting-churn-or-not-1df536d0bb86">link</a>.
This will give broder overview of this project.</p>
